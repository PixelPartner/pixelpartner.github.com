# Talk and handsOn at the CampusPartyEurope2012 in Berlin

Next friday, I will give a talk about my open source activities (truecolor3D, openKMQ3D, openMy3D, 3dvideocasting, ...) at the Campus Party in Berlin.

There's still one free guest ticket (for the full event) to give away.

UPDATE
------

On Feb,14 2013, I heard from one of the german CampusParty freelancer organizers that they all have not been payed for their efforts for the show. BUUUH!

# The LIKE ME button had to go as well

After spending hours to apologize by email and to move my group memberships away 
from Y! I also remembered a german privacy protection policy and decided to kick out 
the Like me on Facebook Button/ iFrame.

The link to my Facebook group is still availbale for you to join in, but the tiny, 
harmless looking thumb-up icon had a severe "behind the scenes" activity.

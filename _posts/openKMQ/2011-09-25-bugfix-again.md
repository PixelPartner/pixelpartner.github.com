# Another bugfix for trueColor3D on OSX

I'm sorry to say, but instead of making the version for Windows and Linux available, 
I found out about another bug and decided to first fix it.

Therefor, we now have version 0.99 on OSX that you can find <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7623044/openKMQ/trueColor3D_0_99_OSX_bin.zip">here</a> for download. <br /><br />And, since last week the source code is hosted on the open source sharing/colaboration platform <a href="http://github.com/PixelPartner/trueColor3D">github</a>

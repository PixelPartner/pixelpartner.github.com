# How to best watch trueColor3D video clips on Android tablets

I recently saw a trueColor3D video on a Samsung Galaxy Tab using the over/under method similar to my iPad experience.<br />Unfortunately the native Android Apps for vimeo and Youtube both limit playback to landscape videos, so I recommend to use the webBrowser to visit these sites. <br />And the limitations of framesizes and bandwidth are more strict as on my old iPad1. <br />There are some videos that play fine on iOS 4.2 but bring an "unknown" error on Android 2.3.x<br /><br />If anyone knows more about these obscure limits, please tell me more, so I can finetune the presets of trueColor3D.exe

[Andrew Murchie's overview of the new Youtube 3D tagging.](http://www.enhanced-dimensions.com/wordpress/?p=2518)

So now, you can simply upload a trueColor3D made over/under (aka iPad3D) clip of 768x1024 to Youtube and tag it with 
yt3d:enable=RonL

This way, it plays on all FLASH-enabled browsers in selectable 3D modes, also plays on iPad 
using the KMQ or compatible viewers and can be used with StereoPlayer and NVidia shutter glasses.

# What's left ?

Okay - for smartphone support you still need an undistorted side-by-side version like the my3D with 1280x480px, also made with trueColor3D.

And for glasses-free viewing on iPad, we still need the GRilli3D1024 layout.

# Pinkau Entertainment brings its showreel to trueColor3D

With the help of trueColor3D 0.97 on OSX the following variants have been converted and uploaded to vimeo :
* for <a href="http://vimeo.com/28351280">3D smartphone goggles</a> (like the Hasbro my3D or the TOYin3D)
* for <a href="http://vimeo.com/28308186">tablet devices</a> (like the Apple iPad using an over/under viewer)
* for <a href="http://vimeo.com/28301331">laptops and any normal LCD</a> (also using the over/under method).

Find out more about the german team of <a href="http://www.pinkau.de">Thomas Pinkau</a>.
They also have a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wgnitIMaEo">Youtube3D</a> upload (unfortunately only a distorted, aka frame compatible version).

I hope to also find trueColor3D version on Youtube soon.

After having some trouble with the libav parts used in ffmpeg, I found workarounds and now proudly present version 0.96.
I recently only worked on OSX Lion, so for now only the OSX binaries are available. 

This version is the first to run without *AviSynth*, 
the very powerful, but Windows-only video post processing toolbox.

It outputs clips that can either play YT3D downloads for home use 
using [AirVideo](http://www.inmethod.com/air-video/index.html), 
or to upload your own work to Youtube (yes they play on iPad and iPhone, 
here are some [examples](http://www.youtube.com/user/3DoniPad) from a beta tester) or even 
[vimeo](http://www.vimeo.com/pixelpartner). 
You can also use it to prepare *3-D podcasts (testing)* or clips to *embed in iOS Apps*
to sell on the *Apple AppStore*.

Email me, if you need the new features also under Windows that is currently on version 0.94. 

* Download the [source code](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7623044/openKMQ/trueColor3D_0_96_src.zip).
* Download the [binaries for OSX](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7623044/openKMQ/trueColor3D_0_96_OSX_bin.zip).

Make sure to install both trueColor3D and qt-faststart as well as a decent version of ffmpeg in your path.
I recently explained how to [install/build ffmpeg on OSX](http://openkmq.blogspot.com/2011/08/how-to-get-ffmpeg-to-run-on-osx.html).

If you find this tool useful, please recommend it and consider opening a [flattr account](http://flattr.com).

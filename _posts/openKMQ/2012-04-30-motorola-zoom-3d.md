# Motorola zoom can play trueColor3D over/und clips in portrait mode

I recently took a coach to Vienna to attend the <a href="http://3dimensional.at">http://www.3dimensionale.at</a> and found myself sitting next to a <b>zoom 1</b> user. I showed him the KMQ s3D viewing method on my iPad and we also tried to watch one of the KMQ clips on vimeo. 

After many disappointing failed attempts with older Android tablets who always forced video to landscape orientation, I was surprised - the zoom was able to play a portrait video in portrait orientation.
